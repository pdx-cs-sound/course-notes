## Effect: Tremolo / Vibrato

* Vibrato: Oscillate the pitch of a signal. Resample as an
  effect (later), or just mess with the instrument

* Tremolo: Oscillate the volume of a signal. Easy effect

* **Butâ€¦**: "The tremolo arm on your favorite guitar, for
  example, is actually a vibrato arm."
  ([source](https://www.sweetwater.com/insync/what-is-the-difference-between-vibrato-and-tremolo/))
  So these terms are used interchangeably.

## Effect: Wah

* Classic frequency-domain effect

* Idea: lowpass filter with variable passband

* Human vocal tract is subtractive via low-pass filters:
  "ooh" is low-pass, "aah" is less low-pass (note inverse
  connection to speaker size)

* [Typical implementation](http://www.matthieuamiguet.ch/blog/diy-guitar-effects-python)
  is with an IIR filter cascade (need to keep number of
  coefficients small to be able to update the filter in
  reasonable
  time). [Biquad sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_biquad_filter)
  are a popular choice, as here.

* See above for demos, also Audacity "auto-wah"

## Delay Effects

* Digital delay is crazily cheap and good

* Amount of delay determined by effect

  * Small delay (< 10ms): Phase cancellation, localization

  * Moderate delay (10-100ms): "Ensemble" effect
    ([example](http://www.cloneensemble.com))

  * Moderate to long delay (50-500ms): Reverb and echo effects

* Multiple delay effects can be combined; delayed signal can
  be chained with other effects

* Wet/dry is a big thing with delay effects, e.g. echo

* Very common to feed delayed signal back into input for
  reverb / echo effects

## Effect: Flanger / Phaser / Chorus

* [Flanger](https://www.dsprelated.com/freebooks/pasp/Flanging.html):
  Mix original signal with varying delay of few ms; creates
  varying "comb filter" by phase cancellation ([Nyquist](https://www.audacityteam.org/about/nyquist/) [plugin](https://forum.audacityteam.org/viewtopic.php?t=95059))

* Phaser: Simulation of flanger using cascade of biquad
  "all-pass filters" to get multiple phase cancellations.
  Originally an analog flanger substitute, but different
  enough to survive (Audacity effect)

* [Chorus](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Chorus_Effect.html):
  Use a multi-tap delay line and vary the tap positions to
  get varying delay and frequency shift. Less pronounced
  than ensemble effect (Nyquist [plugin](https://forum.audacityteam.org/viewtopic.php?t=68007))

* These terms are used pretty interchangeably; no standard
  vocab

## Effect: Reverb and Room Effects

* Idea: Signal + delayed copy simulating resonance and
  bouncing

* Typically longish delays (100ms+)

* Typically delayed copy is filtered and damped

* Output-to-input copy is pretty standard

* Really fancy 3D sound modeling is a thing: leads into
  general acoustics (study of physical sound)

## Effect: Resampling

* Not really an "effect": just a thing

* Very common operation

* Need: 44.1Ksps in, 48Ksps out; 48Ksps in, 44.1Ksps out

* Idea: Just insert or remove samples, but carefully

* Time domain: try to interpolate when inserting or removing
  samples to maintain waveshape

* Frequency domain: filter and decimate, interpolate and
  filter

* Trickier than it looks to do well.

* As an effect: "sped up" (Chipmunks) or "slowed down"
  (sleepy) version of the sound

## Effect: Frequency Stretching

* Frequency domain equivalent of resampling

* Idea: lengthen or shorten a signal while keeping its
  harmonic content the same

* Time domain: Try to find the period of the signal,
  interpolate whole periods; useful period may be
  impractically long

* Frequency domain: Take DFT, scale it up or down
  (interpolate / decimate in frequency domain), take inverse
  DFT; Fourier uncertainty is a problem, multiscale is hard

* The difficulty of this plan is why video is time-scaled
  rather than audio

* AKA pitch-shifting, because pitch is log-frequency, so
  multiplication becomes addition
