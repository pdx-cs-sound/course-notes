## Disclaimer

*Everything about this syllabus is entirely tentative, and
 maybe be changed at the whim of the instructor without
 warning.*

## Description

In this course we will learn to use computers and software
to work and play with sound and music.

Digital pervades every aspect of sound and music these
days. It's all driven by software. We write software. Let's
try to understand all of this at some superficial level in
just ten weeks.

This is a programming-intensive survey course. We will give
an overview of many areas of digital audio and music
analysis, construction, and transformation.

## Prerequisites

**Required Courses:** CS 201, CS 202, CS 350

Familiarity with programming in general and C/C++ in
particular is required. Basic ability to use the Linux
environment is required. Python experience is highly
desirable.

## Goals, Topics and Objectives

Upon the successful completion of this course students will be able to: 

* Identify and process standard representations of
  digital audio, including PCM (e.g. WAV), lossless
  (e.g. FLAC) and lossy (e.g. MP3) compressed audio, and
  MIDI.

* Use Digital Signal Processing techniques to work with
  audio, including both time and frequency domain methods.

* Understand and produce common digital audio effects.

* Synthesize sound using standard and advanced digital
  techniques.

* Understand and apply principles of music structure and
  composition in the analysis and generation of digital
  music.

## Readings

Readings will be assigned from the Internet.

## Course Communication

### Remote Course

I will be teaching this course remotely for this
offering. This will be a challenge for all of us. I am
confident we can get a good outcome, but please bear with me
as we work the details out.

To participate effectively in this course, you will need to
have good Internet access, including outside of lecture
hours. In addition, you will need some sort of computer at
home that you can program to do audio: because this is an
audio course, remote access to PSU computers is not really
an option. If either of these is a problem for you, please
contact me as soon as possible so we can try to work out an
accommodation.

Lectures will be starting at the listed course time (2:00 PM
Monday, Wednesday) using the Zoom meeting tool. While it is
possible that some lectures will run the full two hours, a
lecture time of about one hour will be normal. In addition,
short video lectures will be posted to YouTube and PSU
MediaSpace that you should watch before each
lecture. Lecture time will be focused on demonstrations and
discussion. Lectures will be recorded for later viewing if
necessary, but you are strongly encouraged to attend in
real-time if at all possible.

### Communication Tools

Email will be used infrequently. You are required to use
your official `pdx.edu` email address as registered with the
University to participate in this course. This enables
greater security for online communications.

Lectures will be online via the
[PSU Zoom](http://pdx.zoom.us) videoconferencing tool.
Lecture invites will be distributed on Slack (see below). 

This course will use the Moodle "Learning Management System"
instead of Desire2Learn, because Moodle works better. The
insructor will enroll students in the Moodle: if the course
has begun and you are still not enrolled, contact the
instructor.  The course page for the Moodle is
[here]($@COURSEVIEWBYID*11@$).

Online communications for this course will be through a
shared workspace provided by the [Slack](http://slack.com)
chat tool.  Everyone is required to participate in the
channel.  Please see the top of the course Moodle page for a
course Slack invite link (available once the Moodle is set
up) if you don't already have one. Please use Slack for
discussion with other students, and as the first-choice
place to message me if you want to discuss. I should be
available pretty solidly on Slack during the quarter.
However, I'd encourage you to post to the course Slack
channel if possible, as some other student may get to your
question quicker.

Video will be shared on
[my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/profbartmassey/)
in the
Sound and Music Programming playlist
as well as on [PSU MediaSpace](https://media.pdx.edu/).

## Course Work

### Workload

This course requires substantial out-of-class homework and
study.  Expect to spend at least 8 hours of out-of-class
time each week mastering this difficult material.

I encourage group collaboration on individual assignments:
using the course Slack or creating online chat-room study
groups to discuss the approach and understand the problem is
encouraged. The write-up, programming, and actual solutions
must be your individual work. If you represent someone
else's work as your own, you are committing plagiarism (see
below).

### Homework

I will assign homework.  Late homeworks will be accepted, if
at all, only for good reasons and at a substantial penalty.

You may submit a homework as many times as you like, with
the latest assignment received before grading being the only
one considered for a grade. Please submit something before
the deadline, even if it is only your name&mdash;you can
then continue to work on your assignment as desired up until
they are graded.

Assignments will be graded for having been turned in and
having made a reasonable effort, as well as for a reasonable
degree of correctness.

### Course Project

There will be a substantial course project starting at about
week three. This project may be completed individually or in
groups of 2-4 as desired.

### Grading

Homework assignments are currently planned to count for
about 60% of your course grade; the other 40% being for the
project. This may change, however. No exams are planned or
expected. There may be some quizzes as part of the homework
assignment, depending on how things work out.

A zero on any one assignment will result in a zero for the
course. Please turn in something for every assignment.

## Academic Honesty

Cheating on homework or the project will result in a grade
of zero on the affected material, and will be reported to
appropriate authorities.  Plagiarism is a form of
cheating. Please do not let me catch you plagiarizing.

> Plagiarism: n 1: a piece of writing/work that has been
copied from someone else and is presented as being your own
work 2: the act of plagiarizing; taking someone's words or
ideas as if they were your own.

If you use code, ideas, or text authored by someone else,
cite them. It is OK to get help from external sources of
knowledge, but citation is mandatory.

## Access and Inclusion for Students with Disabilities

PSU values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to
fostering mutual respect and full participation for all
students. My goal is to create a learning environment that
is equitable, useable, inclusive, and welcoming. If any
aspects of instruction or course design result in barriers
to your inclusion or learning, please notify me. The
Disability Resource Center (DRC) provides reasonable
accommodations for students who encounter barriers in the
learning environment.

If you have, or think you may have, a disability that may
affect your work in this class and feel you need
accommodations, contact the Disability Resource Center to
schedule an appointment and initiate a conversation about
reasonable accommodations. The DRC is located in 116 Smith
Memorial Student Union, 503-725-4150, drc@pdx.edu,
<https://www.pdx.edu/drc>.

If you already have accommodations, please contact me to
make sure that I have received a faculty notification letter
and discuss your accommodations.  For information about
emergency preparedness, please go to the Fire and Life
Safety webpage
<https://www.pdx.edu/environmental-health-safety/fire-and-life-safety>
for information.

person must share the information with their supervisor, the
University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Office of the Dean
of Student Life. However, the Title IX Coordinators will
keep the information confidential and refer you to a
confidential advocate.
