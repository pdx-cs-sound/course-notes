## "MIDI File"

* [Standard](http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~ich/classes/mumt306/StandardMIDIfileformat.html) for capturing MIDI events for replay

* RIFF format again. Ugh

* Not too usable as a notation

## "Piano Roll" Notation

* [Player piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aseMAEctM1s)

* Used by sequencers

* Easy for new musicians to understand

* A bit hard to see what's going on

* Pretty extensively used in modern production

## Classical Notation

* Compromise for legibility

* Cockpit problem

* Tuned to classical European music theory

* (Musescore 3 demo)

## Roman Numeral Notation For Chords

* Later
