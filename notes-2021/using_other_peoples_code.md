    One of the things that comes up in any CS class is the use
of code off the Internets in coursework. Here's my policy,
which is mine â€” other instructors may differ. Here also are
some guidelines to make your use of other people's code
better.

You may use any code that you find on the Internet that
meets the following conditions. That's not *everything,* but
it's a lot.

1. The author must have legally and ethically allowed you to
   use the code.

    * Legally: Under international copyright law, someone
      who writes code owns it. You can't do anything with it
      (except maybe read it, if it has been published)
      unless they give you permission.

      Permission comes as a *license:* the author must say
      that you can use the code. A license may have
      conditions that you must meet.

      Sometimes the license is implicit: for example, posts
      to StackOverflow are covered by a blanket license
      statement from StackOverflow that the poster agrees to
      by posting.  But you have to have a license.

    * Ethically: If it is clear that the author would not
      want you to use the code, you must not use it even if
      they somehow accidentally gave you a license. Your use
      of the code should be in a way that treats the author
      fairly: for example, critique of the code should be
      polite and honest.

2. You must *attribute* the code. That is, you must say what
   you got and where you got it from, in a way that allows
   me and others to find it later.

   Usually the right way to attribute someone else's code is
   to put a comment in your code with the URL you retrieved
   it from. If the URL is potentially going to change or you
   got the code from somewhere else, the comment needs more
   detail.

3. You must understand the code. You shouldn't be using code
   unless you could write something similar yourself once
   you have understood what it is doing. This is
   extra-important for StackOverflow posts, which are
   usually a useful fact surrounded in terrible code with
   bugs and bad style.

4. In general it is better use of your time to look at other
   people's code, understand it, and write your own code
   using your new understanding. You must *still put in
   attribution* so that other people can find your
   inspiration.

5. If you turn in something that is mostly someone else's
   code, but is attributed, you will not be penalized. But
   you won't get many points for it, either. To get a good
   score you should have written most of your code yourself.

Hopefully this is clear. Have fun with the Internets!
