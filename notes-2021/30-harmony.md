# Harmonies

* Polyphony: more than one note being sounded at a time

* Can get a long ways with a MiniMoog playing monophonic,
  but even then a band is helpful, so probably polyphony

* A bunch of the scale setup — in particular, "equal
  temperament" — is desiged to make polyphony sound good

# The Basic Three-Note Chord

* There can be only one — well, one major, one minor

* 1-3-5 major, 1-3♭-5 minor

* Note that we have abandoned note names here: a "C major
  chord" and a "D♭ major chord" have frequencies in the same
  relationship, but with a different base pitch

* In other words, we pick a scale, then use the root, third
  and fifth notes of that scale to make a chord

# Roman Numeral Notation

* Step 1: pick a scale (key)

* Notate the major chord starting at the root as I

* The minor chord is i (lowercase I) of a minor scale

* There are major chords that start on each
  note in the scale: notate these I, II, III, IV, V,
  VI, VII

* Except typically you make the chords out of notes in the
  scale, so the normal thing would be I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi
  and…uh vii°

* vii° is a "diminished chord": 1-3♭-5♭ (starting from
  note 7)

* For minor scale would be i, ii°, III, iv, v (or V in
  classical), VI, VII

# What Do Chords Sound Like?

* Major chords sound happy, minor chords sound sad

* Diminished chords are kind of spooky and mysterious-sounding

* (The "augmented chord" 1-3-5♯ sounds like it's going
  somewhere — you'll hear it occasionally)
  
# Octaves and Inversions

* It is common to use octave notes of the chord to add to
  a chord, either above or below. A big "chord stack" is its
  own thing

* It matters which note is on the bottom in a chord:

  * 1 on bottom is the "root chord": 1-3-5 notated e.g I

  * 3 on bottom is the "first inversion": 3-5-1 notated e.g. $I^6$

  * 5 on bottom is the "second inversion": 5-1-3 notated e.g. $I^6_4$

# Adding Notes

* A common addition to a chord is the 7 tone,
  either flatted ("natural seventh") or not ("major
  seventh")

* The are several different Roman Numeral conventions
  floating around for sevenths: see
  [this chart](https://davidkulma.com/musictheory/romannumerals)
  for one such

* The inversion notation gets messy; let us not care

* The 9 tone, 11 tone, 13 tone may be added for increasing
  dissonance. This is mostly a jazz thing

# More About Minors

* "Relative minor" starts on 6 of major: has same key
  signature

* "Parallel minor" starts on 1 of major: has different key
  signature

* (Other minors start on other tones)

# Pop

* Cast a big net here: Pop intermingles with Rock, Rock is
  inspired by world rhythms, Blues, Jazz, and (yes) Country

* Pop is noted for its simplicity: I, IV, V chords dominate,
  vi, ii, iii (or III) (relative minor) chords are frequent

* Pop is typically not notated with Roman Numerals, but with
  named chords in a particular key. Often a melody in
  standard musical notation is used — a "lead sheet"

* Even when full music is provided, the lead line (melody)
  will typically be on a separate staff, and the lettered
  chords will be included

* Here's an example:
  [Let My Love Open The Door](https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0089316)
  by Pete Townshend

* The bass line is also commonly included. Pop bass
  line is often just root note of current chord, in rhythm

* More could be said about bass, but time…

# Chord Motifs Are Reused In Pop

* Many of you will have seen *Four Chords* by Axis of
  Awesome

* Common Pop chord progressions

  * Four Chords: I-V-vi-IV

  * Blues: I-IV-I-V-IV or so

  * 50s: I-vi-IV-V

  * Pachelbel: I-V-vi-iii-IV-I-ii-V

  * [many more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chord_progressions)

# Pop, Key Changes, and the Circle Of Fourths

* We are playing in equal temperament so that we can shift
  keys during a piece

* Common pop motif: jump up the circle of fourths 1-4 steps,
  eventually walk back down or jump back

* *Brain Damage* by Pink Floyd:

  * Verse: I-IV7-I-IV7-I-I7-IV-iv-V-V7-I

  * Chorus: IV-V-♭VI-IV (repeat)

# Fancier Pop Chords

* It's not all just formulaic: some songs have really fancy
  chords

* I'm a big fan of Supertramp: they do a bunch of this stuff
  — diminished chords, diminished sevenths, fancy key
  changes, etc

# Computer Things

* When analyzing music:

  * Be aware that a lead sheet is a viable product

  * Chords are hard to sort out of pop music, since there's
    so much other noise and so many harmonics for each note
    (freakin' guitars)

  * Top note is usually melody, bottom note is usually bass
    and gives tonic of chord

* When generating music:

  * Chords come first, bass second, melody third

  * The melody should be in the scale corresponding to the
    chord: some "accidentals" are fine

  * This is just a starting point: go find out more things

  * "To the Obviousmobile" (gets in Obviousmobile)
