## The Equal-Tempered Scale

* What we've been using so far

* Compromises "perfect" intervals (small periods) in any one
  scale to get the ability to move between scales seamlessly
  
* All 12 * 11 intervals in an octave are "wrong"

* This is a "new" idea: only a few hundred years old

# Consonant Intervals

* In a major scale

  * Third (four steps up from root) is roughly 5/4 the
    frequency of the root

  * Fifth (seven steps up from the root) is roughly 3/2 the
    frequency of the root

  * These intervals have a reasonably regular wave structure
    with periods 4 and 3 root cycles respectively, so sound
    "pure"

* In a minor scale

  * Minor third (three steps up from the root) is roughly
    6/5 the frequency of the root with period 5

* Note the "roughly": the equal temperament compromise
  means that these frequencies are a little off and
  periods are thus long

* Thirds are particularly bad, being about 1% (1 cent) off.
  Most humans cannot hear a 1 cent difference. It is easy to
  detect it with a tuner.

# The Guitar Fretboard

* Let's look at a [guitar
  fretboard](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Gibson_SG_Special.JPG)

* Note that the spacing of frets is not even. Why?

* Note that a third is 1/6 of the way down a string, and a
  fifth 1/3 of the way

* Markers are at the minor third, fourth, fifth, sixth intervals,
  double marker at the octave, then repeat

* Intonation: adjust the length of each string at the bridge
  to make the marker positions right — different from
  tuning by adjusting string tension

* Pickup position matters (hence two sets of pickups) — why? 

## Pythagorean Tunings

* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning>

    * Assign the fifth tone (7 steps up) a frequency 3/2 the
      root

    * Keep going like that, wrapping at octave boundaries

    * Eventually will have assigned a frequency to every note

    * But you'll miss matching up again by quite a lot

    * So instead go up and down by seven steps, so that the
      messed up position lies on "some weird black key you
      don't care about" (flat 6)

* Thirds are terrible, so maybe try to get them more right

* Sounds good for things near C, bad at far-away keys

## Circle Of Fifths (Fourths)

* Even in equal temperament, can be useful to think about
  going up five (seven half-steps) or down five (seven
  half-steps)

* This gives the fourth and fifth note of the scale

* A C major scale up a fifth has just one black key: by
  convention this is the sharp 7

* A C major scale down a fifth (up a fourth) has just one
  black key: by convention this is the flat 4

* Continuing "around the circle" gets more sharps / flats
