## Hearing — The Ear

* [Physics of hearing](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/how-do-we-hear)

* Note that the ear detects frequency *directly*

* The measured sound amplitude is *logarithmic* in the
  sampled sound power: big differences at low power,
  small differences at high power

* Thus usually use units of dB instead of linear power

        P[dB] = 20 log_10 (P * 10**12)

* C.f. "type A" and "type B" potentiometers as
  "[volume knobs](http://www.resistorguide.com/potentiometer-taper/)"

## Hearing — Psychoacoustics

* The brain does things with sound…

* Perceived volume of a sound is a function of

    * Background volume level: individual sounds seem less
      loud in a noisy environment

    * Waveshape: in particular, the brain will "fill in"
      "clipped" waves as though the peaks exist. This is used
      by broadcasters to make sounds seem louder than their
      measured power

* Perceived frequency of a sound is

    * Relative: "perfect pitch" is rare; pitch is mostly
      judged by relation to surrounding / background / earlier
      pitches

    * Dominated by high frequency components:
      [dbA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-weighting)
      frequency weighting is used as an estimate of perceived
      loudness

* Accommodation over time, etc happens

* [Shepard Tone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzNzgsAE4F0)
  is an interesting audio illusion

## Hearing — Safety

* Easy to damage hearing permanently

    * Sound exposure is cumulative: long exposure to a
      moderately loud sound is more damaging than short
      exposure to a somewhat louder sound

    * NIOSH: More than 85 dBA (heavy city traffic) over 8
      hours is
      [hazardous](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/default.html)

    * Acute trauma over 130 dBA

    * Not just general hearing loss: notching, tinnitus

* How to stay safe:

    * **Wear ear protection** around sustained or acute loud
      noise: concerts, machine rooms, etc. Wear
      noise-cancelling headphones on airplanes

    * **Avoid earbuds**, as they are prone to causing hearing
      damage. If you use them, turn them down to *below* where
      they sound best: the ear / brain don't know how to deal
      with them

    * **Turn down all volume controls** (especially master
      volume) before powering up any audio equipment. Then
      raise the volume to a *comfortable level*

    * **Put headphones on your neck** to start; you should
      hear silence. Then put them on and turn up the volume

    * **See above** when working with mute buttons, plugs and
      jacks, etc. So easy to make a mistake!

## Hearing — Two Ears

* Normally hear in *stereo*; thus two-channel audio with
  separated sources (headphones, left and right speakers)

* Means two audio channels to deal with: stereo is sometimes
  encoded as sum and difference channels, with the
  difference channel at lower fidelity

* [Localization in space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_localization)
  is a function of time difference and level difference
  between ears

    * Angle:

        * Phase is used below 1KHz

        * Head interference and group delay is used above 1.5KHz

        * This is part of what the "ears" (pinna) do

    * Distance:

        * Softer, lower-frequency sounds seem farther away

        * Room effects (reflection) increase perceived distance
