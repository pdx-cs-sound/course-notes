of hearing</a></p></li>
<li><p>Note that the ear detects frequency <em>directly</em></p></li>
<li><p>The measured sound amplitude is <em>logarithmic</em> in the
sampled sound power: big differences at low power, small differences at
high power</p></li>
<li><p>Thus usually use units of dB instead of linear power</p>
<pre><code>  P[dB] = 20 log_10 (P * 10**12)</code></pre></li>

<h2 id="hearing-psychoacoustics">Hearing &#x2014; Psychoacoustics</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The brain does things with sound&#x2026;</p></li>
<li><p>Perceived volume of a sound is a function of</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Background volume level: individual sounds seem less loud in a
noisy environment</p></li>
<li><p>Waveshape: in particular, the brain will &#x201C;fill in&#x201D; &#x201C;clipped&#x201D;
waves as though the peaks exist. This is used by broadcasters to make
sounds seem louder than their measured power</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Perceived frequency of a sound is</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Relative: &#x201C;perfect pitch&#x201D; is rare; pitch is mostly judged by
relation to surrounding / background / earlier pitches</p></li>
<li><p>Dominated by high frequency components: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-weighting">dbA</a> frequency
weighting is used as an estimate of perceived loudness</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Accommodation over time, etc happens</p></li>

<h2 id="hearing-safety">Hearing &#x2014; Safety</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Easy to damage hearing permanently</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sound exposure is cumulative: long exposure to a moderately loud
sound is more damaging than short exposure to a somewhat louder
sound</p></li>
<li><p>NIOSH: More than 85 dBA (heavy city traffic) over 8 hours is <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/default.html">hazardous</a></p></li>
<li><p>Acute trauma over 130 dBA</p></li>
<li><p>Not just general hearing loss: notching, tinnitus</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How to stay safe:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Wear ear protection</strong> around sustained or acute
loud noise: concerts, machine rooms, etc. Wear noise-cancelling
headphones on airplanes</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid earbuds</strong>, as they are prone to causing
hearing damage. If you use them, turn them down to <em>below</em> where
they sound best: the ear / brain don&#x2019;t know how to deal with
them</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Turn down all volume controls</strong> (especially master
volume) before powering up any audio equipment. Then raise the volume to
a <em>comfortable level</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Put headphones on your neck</strong> to start; you should
hear silence. Then put them on and turn up the volume</p></li>
<li><p><strong>See above</strong> when working with mute buttons, plugs
and jacks, etc. So easy to make a mistake!</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="hearing-two-ears">Hearing &#x2014; Two Ears</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Normally hear in <em>stereo</em>; thus two-channel audio with
separated sources (headphones, left and right speakers)</p></li>
<li><p>Means two audio channels to deal with: stereo is sometimes
encoded as sum and difference channels, with the difference channel at
lower fidelity</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_localization">Localization in
space</a> is a function of time difference and level difference between
ears</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Angle:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Phase is used below 1KHz</p></li>
<li><p>Head interference and group delay is used above 1.5KHz</p></li>
<li><p>This is part of what the &#x201C;ears&#x201D; (pinna) do</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Distance (not really stereo):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Softer, lower-frequency sounds seem farther away</p></li>
<li><p>Room effects (reflection) increase perceived distance</p></li>
</ul></li>
