## Noise

* It is easy to produce sound that contains a jumble of
  frequencies

* Wind and wave sounds are examples of *noise*,
  non-repeating signals characterized by statistical
  randomness

* Because noise is non-repeating but continuous, it does not
  have a characteristic frequency / tone; it is accurate to
  think about it as containing randomly varying components
  of all audible frequencies

## Impulse

* Gunshots and claps are examples of *impulses*: a single
  pressure spike propagates through the air

* The impulse can initially be thought of as containing
  all audible frequencies

* Impulses will be damped by travel through the air,
  decaying into silence quite rapidly

## Vibration

* A string or reed, for example, will vibrate in response to
  an impulse or noise

* Vibration is typically repetitive, with a characteristic
  frequency *f*

* Vibration will also typically contain multiples of the
  fundamental frequency *f*: *2f* *3f* *4f* etc at lower
  amplitudes. These are called harmonics, are due to
  nonlinearity in the vibrating material, and are important
  to the sound

* Vibration is the classical solution to the ordinary
  differential equation describing a
  [spring-mass system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator#Spring/mass_system)

  $$ m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -k x $$

  for some "mass" *m* and "spring constant" *k*, namely

  $$ x = A ~ \textrm{cos} ~ \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} t $$

  where the amplitude *A* is arbitrary. In practice *A* is
  determined by the excitation of the system: an impulse
  decays, a noise persists

## Resonance

* A *resonant cavity* is a filter: amplifies frequencies
  near wavelength (and multiples), suppresses other
  frequencies. Wikipedia has a nice
  [explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_resonance)
  for various common cavities

* Most sound-producing things operate in/with a resonant cavity:
  voice, instruments, etc

## Natural Sound — Acoustic Instruments

* Noisemaker + resonant cavity

    * Wind: buzzing lips, vibrating reed, tube

    * String: vibrating string, usually cavity

    * Percussion: impulse, usually cavity

    * "Misc" e.g. [bagpipes](https://youtu.be/vqyvZHnJh8k?t=39)

* Pitch adjustment by tension or length; cavity length
  modification via holes (or slide) — so many choices

* Most but not all *monophonic*: one sound at a time

## Natural Sound — Voice

* The human
  [vocal tract](https://www.voicescienceworks.org/vocal-tract.html)

* Breath exciting vibrating sound source ("vocal chords" —
  actually vocal folds), resonant cavity (larynx, mouth,
  etc)

* Frequency range unsurprisingly similar to hearing range
