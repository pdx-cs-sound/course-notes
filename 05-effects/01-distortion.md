## Distortion and Noise Effects

* Simulate familiar signal paths from history: tube guitar amp

* Add "warmth" to sound: human hearing likes rich signals:
  old radio broadcast

* Get "surreal" weird sounds: kazoo

## Adding Noise To Sound

* Easy to make "white noise" with an RNG

* Usually want to modulate the noise

    * Noise volume envelope: flute

    * Noise frequency envelope

## Distorting Sound

* Clipping is the common distortion already discussed

* More likely is "soft clipping" that smoothly approaches and
  leaves limits: tube amp

* Soft clipping can be quite subtle and still effective

* Weirdly, asymmetric clipping is a thing that works sometimes

## Vacuum Tubes Are Complicated

* Soft clipping to first order

* Physical model concerned with

    * Interaction of tube with nonlinear audio path: transformer

    * Interaction of tube with power supply: rectifier

    * Voltage (clipping) limits

* Some really complicated physics happens

## Weird Distortion

* Ring modulation

* Intermodulation

## Digital Distortion

* "8-bit" quantization

* Glitch effects

* Aliasing effects
