# Audio Data Transmission

## Why?

* Send / receive in situations in which other communications
  media don't work (or don't work well)
  
* Sort of last-resort because bandwidth

## How?

* Acoustically
  * Simple signaling, for example bugle for military, air
    raid siren
  * Ultrasonic signalling from TV/Radio to microphone
  
* Electronically
  * Morse Code (CW radio)
  * MODEM

## MODEM

* Data over the phone line (or other audio channel)
  * Acoustic Coupler: Microphone to phone speaker, speaker
    to phone microphone
  * Direct-coupled

* Old School: Frequency Shift Keying
  * Tone for 0, another tone for 1
  * "start" bit and "stop" bit(s)
  * Parity bit? 0 if even number of 1 bits byte, 1 otherwise
  * 110 bps, 300 bps
