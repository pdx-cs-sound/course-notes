<h2 id="the-equal-tempered-scale">The Equal-Tempered Scale</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>What we&#x2019;ve been using so far</p></li>
<li><p>Compromises &#x201C;perfect&#x201D; intervals (small periods) in any one scale
to get the ability to move between scales seamlessly</p></li>
<li><p>All 12 * 11 intervals in an octave are &#x201C;wrong&#x201D;</p></li>
<li><p>This is a &#x201C;new&#x201D; idea: only a few hundred years old</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="consonant-intervals">Consonant Intervals</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>In a major scale</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Third (four steps up from root) is roughly 5/4 the frequency of
the root</p></li>
<li><p>Fifth (seven steps up from the root) is roughly 3/2 the frequency
of the root</p></li>
<li><p>These intervals have a reasonably regular wave structure with
periods 4 and 3 root cycles respectively, so sound &#x201C;pure&#x201D;</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In a minor scale</p>
<ul>
<li>Minor third (three steps up from the root) is roughly 6/5 the
frequency of the root with period 5</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Note the &#x201C;roughly&#x201D;: the equal temperament compromise means that
these frequencies are a little off and periods are thus long</p></li>
<li><p>Thirds are particularly bad, being about 1% (1 cent) off. Most
humans cannot hear a 1 cent difference. It is easy to detect it with a
tuner.</p></li>

<h1 id="the-guitar-fretboard">The Guitar Fretboard</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Let&#x2019;s look at a <a
href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Gibson_SG_Special.JPG">guitar
fretboard</a></p></li>
<li><p>Note that the spacing of frets is not even. Why?</p></li>
<li><p>Note that a third is 1/6 of the way down a string, and a fifth
1/3 of the way</p></li>
<li><p>Markers are at the minor third, fourth, fifth, sixth intervals,
double marker at the octave, then repeat</p></li>
<li><p>Intonation: adjust the length of each string at the bridge to
make the marker positions right &#x2014; different from tuning by adjusting
string tension</p></li>
<li><p>Pickup position matters (hence two sets of pickups) &#x2014;
why?</p></li>

<h2 id="pythagorean-tunings">Pythagorean Tunings</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning"
class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Assign the fifth tone (7 steps up) a frequency 3/2 the
root</p></li>
<li><p>Keep going like that, wrapping at octave boundaries</p></li>
<li><p>Eventually will have assigned a frequency to every note</p></li>
<li><p>But you&#x2019;ll miss matching up again by quite a lot</p></li>
<li><p>So instead go up and down by seven steps, so that the messed up
position lies on &#x201C;some weird black key you don&#x2019;t care about&#x201D; (flat
6)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Thirds are terrible, so maybe try to get them more right</p></li>
<li><p>Sounds good for things near C, bad at far-away keys</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="circle-of-fifths-fourths">Circle Of Fifths (Fourths)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Even in equal temperament, can be useful to think about going up
five (seven half-steps) or down five (seven half-steps)</p></li>
<li><p>This gives the fourth and fifth note of the scale</p></li>
<li><p>A C major scale up a fifth has just one black key: by convention
this is the sharp 7</p></li>
<li><p>A C major scale down a fifth (up a fourth) has just one black
key: by convention this is the flat 4</p></li>
<li><p>Continuing &#x201C;around the circle&#x201D; gets more sharps / flats</p></li>
</ul>
